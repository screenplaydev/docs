# Introduction

**Welcome to the Graphite beta**

Everything is still a little early, so please add comments if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!

## What is Graphite?

Graphite is an [**open source CLI**](https://github.com/screenplaydev/graphite-cli) + a [**code review dashboard**](http://app.graphite.dev) on top of GitHub that **makes** **creating & reviewing** [**stacked changes**](getting-started/why-use-stacked-changes.md) **fast & intuitive**. Anyone can start using Graphite individually without needing their coworkers to change tools - we seamlessly sync your code changes and reviews. We built Graphite because we missed tools like Phabricator (at Facebook) and Critique (Google) that help engineers create, approve, and ship small, incremental changes, and long-term we’re passionate about creating a powerful, modern code review experience (think Linear for CR) for fast-moving eng teams.

## What can you do with Graphite?

With Graphite, you can:

*   **Easily develop with stacked changes locally**

    Graphite keeps track of your stacks and automates all of the tedious recursive rebases needed to support a stacked changes workflow.
*   **Create and update pull requests for the branches in your stack**

    Graphite makes it easy to open PRs for all branches in your stack and update them as you iterate - and we'll even add a comment to help your reviewers easily navigate to the other PRs in the stack.
*   **View and customize inboxes for your pull requests & reviews**

    Graphite's web dashboard helps you get through code review faster and focus on what's actionable with a powerful, customizable review queue with spit inboxes (i.e. "Needs your review", "Your pull requests", "Your team's pull requests").
*   **Visualize stacks on the code review page**

    Graphite's web dashboard shows you a visualization of all the PRs in a stack at a glance, allowing you to better understand which PRs to review first as well as the subsequent ordering and narrative arc of the stack.
*   **Give thoughtful, actionable code reviews in less time**

    Graphite's modern, keyboard-first interface makes code review fast, intuitive, and enjoyable (with first-class support for fun features like gifs & memes/image macros)
